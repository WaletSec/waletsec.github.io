# Crackme

### Solution

Quick look at the binary tells us that there are two key functions: emmdee5 and esrever. Judging by their names, we need to reverse byte order in hash found in binary (d2862c3379cbf547d317b3b1771a4fb6) and crack it.
I used Python to reverse it:

```bash
>>> a = "d2862c3379cbf547d317b3b1771a4fb6"
>>> "".join([a[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(a), 2)][::-1])
'b64f1a77b1b317d347f5cb79332c86d2'
>>>
```
I gave it to teammate (Mim1r) who cracked it via hashcat (alternatively you could look for it on https://crackstation.net/).
